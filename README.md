# VAMP-decoder-and-capacity-achieving-SS-code
This is a repository of the code of Vector approximate message-passing decoder andcapacity-achieving sparse superposition codes
Here is the relevant code written in python generated by the figure data of the paper "Vector approximate message-passing decoder andcapacity-achieving sparse superposition codes". 

The python file [State_Evolution.py](https://github.com/yzfuteng/VAMP-decoder-and-capacity-achieving-SS-code/blob/main/State_Evolution.py) and [SE_replica.py](https://github.com/yzfuteng/VAMP-decoder-and-capacity-achieving-SS-code/blob/main/SE_replica.py) generate the state evolution of approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm and vector approximate message passing (VAMP) algorithm. [State_Evolution.py](https://github.com/yzfuteng/VAMP-decoder-and-capacity-achieving-SS-code/blob/main/State_Evolution.py) refers to the book "Sparse Regression Codes" , while the formula in [SE_replica.py](https://github.com/yzfuteng/VAMP-decoder-and-capacity-achieving-SS-code/blob/main/SE_replica.py) is given by our paper.

The python file [Simulation.py](https://github.com/yzfuteng/VAMP-decoder-and-capacity-achieving-SS-code/blob/main/Simulation.py) is the vector approximate message passing algorithm, which can generate the partial data of figure 2 and figure 4 in our paper. We use the python function to show it clearly. Specific data and experiments can be set by yourself.
